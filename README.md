# Chess_game
♟️ A chess game project on C#

### How I am planning to make it works
The code will be separated in 4 parts:
- The graphic interface, representing the board with all the pieces at any time and allowing the user to select a piece and to select where it wants to move it
- A class with all the information about a single piece: it's Id, it's color, wether it was eaten or not, where it can moves (using vectors), ...
- A timer, constantly updating
- And finally a main programm, making everything work at once
